1.How to change folder with git bash?

My default git folder is C:\Users\username\.git.

What command should I use to go into C:/project?


The command is:

cd  /c/project/


Use the pwd command to see which path you are currently in, handy when you did a right-click "Git Bash here..."



Here are the steps I followed:

1.In bash, check in which directory you are by using the command:

$ pwd


2.copy the URL of the directory you want to go like after using the first command (PWD) I got:

$  /c/Users/yourUsername

3. Now I want to change this to the directory of c drive and folder MyPictures. To do that, I will go the directory of MyPictures, copy the URL, and paste it in the Git bash. 
However, before that:

Windows Directory Path C:\Users\MyUserFolder\
<—— Becomes......> *nix Directory Path
/c/Users/MyUserFolder/
